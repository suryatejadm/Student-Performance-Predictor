Overview:
The Student Performance Predictor is a machine learning–powered web application built with Python, Flask, and scikit-learn. It predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on inputs such as:

Hours Studied

Attendance Percentage

Previous Grades

🎯 Objective
To demonstrate how a machine learning model can be integrated into a web application for real-time predictions, showcasing both backend logic and a simple frontend interface.

🛠 Tech Stack
Python – Core programming language

Flask – Web framework to build and serve the app

scikit-learn – Machine Learning library (Logistic Regression)

Pandas & NumPy – Data processing

HTML/CSS – Frontend structure and styling

Git & GitHub – Version control and collaboration

✅ Key Features
Predicts student performance (Pass/Fail) using logistic regression

User-friendly form interface for input

Trained on synthetic student data

Fully integrated ML model into a Flask app

Clean project structure, ideal for learning and showcasing full-stack ML integration

🚀 How It Works
Collects user input via a web form (study hours, attendance, grades)

Sends data to the Flask backend

ML model processes the input and returns a prediction

The prediction is displayed instantly on the web page
